## 1. The Dynamic "VIP" List
Goal: Practice list manipulation and user input.
Write a script that starts with an empty list called guests. Use a while loop to continuously ask the user for a name to add to the party list.
If the user types "done", stop the loop and print the final list alphabetically.
If they type a name already in the list, tell them "They're already on the list!" and don't add it again.
Bonus: If the list reaches 5 names, print "The party is full!" and exit.

## 2. The Logic Bouncer
Goal: Master nested conditionals and type casting.
Create a program that asks for a user's age and whether they have a membership card (yes/no).
If they are under 18, they are "Denied."
If they are 18–20, they can enter but "Cannot buy drinks."
If they are 21 or older, check for the membership.
If they have a card, print "Welcome, Gold Member!"
If not, print "Standard entry granted."

## 3. The Number Scrubber
Goal: Combine loops, lists, and math logic.
Start with a list of numbers: data = [12, 45, -3, 0, 101, 22, 7, 88, -15]. Loop through the list and create two new lists:
evens: Should contain all even numbers from the original list.
cleaned: Should contain only positive numbers (greater than 0).
Challenge: At the end, print the average of the cleaned list.

## 4. The "Infinite" Guessing Game
Goal: Integrating everything (Flow Control).
Python has a built-in random module. Use import random and secret = random.randint(1, 20) to generate a number.
Give the user 5 attempts to guess the number.
Use a for loop to track the attempts.
If the guess is too high, print "Lower!"
If the guess is too low, print "Higher!"
If they guess it, print "You win!" and use break to stop the loop.
